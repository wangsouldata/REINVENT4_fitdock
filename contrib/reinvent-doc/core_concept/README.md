# Core Concepts



## Generators

Each generator requires different input and is suited to a different design task.

| Generator | Input required | Task |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| **Reinvent** | None | De novo generation atom-by-atom |
| **LibInvent** | Scaffold SMILES | Decorate a scaffold with R-groups |
| **LinkInvent** | Two fragment SMILES | Find a linker between two fragments |
| **Mol2Mol** | Reference molecule SMILES | Generate analogues within a defined similarity radius |


## Priors and Agents

- **Prior**: a model pre-trained on a large chemical dataset (e.g. ChEMBL) that has learned valid SMILES grammar. It generates molecules without any task-specific bias. Pre-trained priors for all generators are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15641297).
- **Agent**: a copy of the prior whose weights are updated during a run to increase the likelihood of generating high-scoring molecules.

## Model Adaptation

Two methods can be used independently or in sequence:

- **Transfer Learning (TL)**: retrains a prior on a focused SMILES dataset (e.g. known actives for a target), producing an agent biased toward that chemical series.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: iteratively updates the agent using a scoring function as reward signal.

## Staged Learning / Curriculum Learning

RL can be extended into multiple sequential stages. The agent checkpoint from stage N becomes the starting point for stage N+1, each with its own scoring function and termination criterion (`max_score`, `max_steps`). This allows gradually increasing objective complexity — e.g. stage 1 filters with fast, cheap components (structural alerts, drug-likeness) while stage 2 introduces expensive ones (docking). Stages can also be used to manually continue a run from any saved checkpoint.

## Scoring in RL

The scoring function is a weighted combination of components, each computing a property of the generated SMILES (e.g. QED, LogP, TPSA, docking score). Raw values are mapped to [0, 1] via transforms (sigmoid, step, etc.) and aggregated, by default with the geometric mean.

## Diversity vs. Exploitation

RL naturally drives the agent toward high-scoring regions, but without any check it tends to collapse onto a small set of structurally similar molecules, the same scaffold repeated across the batch (see Figure below). This is undesirable in drug discovery, where we want to explore diverse chemotypes that satisfy the same objective. REINVENT4 addresses this with two mechanisms:

REINVENT4 addresses this at two levels:

- **Diversity Filter**: penalises repeated Murcko scaffolds during the run. Molecules are bucketed by scaffold; once a bucket fills, further molecules with that scaffold are penalised. Only molecules above `minscore` enter memory. Types: `IdenticalMurckoScaffold` (recommended), `IdenticalTopologicalScaffold`, `ScaffoldSimilarity` (Tanimoto-based), `PenalizeSameSmiles` (exact SMILES repetition).
- **Inception (Experience Replay)**: replays the highest-scoring molecules seen so far alongside the current batch in the loss computation. Useful when high-scoring molecules are rare — prevents the agent from forgetting them between epochs. Memory can be pre-seeded with known actives. Reinvent only.
